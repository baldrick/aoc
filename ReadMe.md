# What?

adventofcode.com is an advent calendar of puzzles best solved with a computer programme.

Brute forcing puzzles is often an option but there are generally more elegant solutions that are _much_ faster.

# Why?

It's a bit of fun.  Unfortunately also frustration at times.

Really it's an excuse to learn a new language.  That hasn't often been the case for me - I've tended to stick with javascript for the most part although 2020 did see some usage of golang.  I also don't tend to have a lot of time to do these puzzles ... the first couple of years were generally attacked whilst with the in-laws over Christmas and catching up dozens of puzzles in 3-4 days hasn't ever resulted in me solving them all.

This code is most often knocked out in the evening after work and once I've got a working solution I don't bother to refine it.  So don't expect clean code ;-)

# 2021

I used Python for this year.  The language has been around for years but the v2/v3 debacle put me off learning it.  Until now.  Make sure `aoc/2021` is included in your `PYTHONPATH` for these solutions to work.  Python >=3.10 is required.

# 2022

I gave [Julia](https://julialang.org/) a crack this year for no real reason other than I read about it a week or two beforehand...
