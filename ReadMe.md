# What?

adventofcode.com is an advent calendar of puzzles best solved with a computer programme.

Brute forcing puzzles is often an option but there are generally more elegant solutions that are _much_ faster.

# Why?

It's a bit of fun.  Unfortunately also frustration at times.

Really it's an excuse to learn a new language.  That hasn't often been the case for me - I've tended to stick with javascript for the most part although 2020 did see some usage of golang.  I also don't tend to have a lot of time to do these puzzles ... the first couple of years were generally attacked whilst with the in-laws over Christmas and catching up dozens of puzzles in 3-4 days hasn't ever resulted in me solving them all.

This code is most often knocked out in the evening after work and once I've got a working solution I don't bother to refine it.  So don't expect clean code ;-)
